<p>Spin The Wheel <br>
Music and Lyrics - Pablo Casella and Tom Callens<br><br>

See through the light of dawn<br>
Life being drawn<br>
Everyday plays a song<br>
Of the unknown<br><br>

The roulette is on<br>
Chance is upon us<br>
<br>
How many queens have we won<br>
Pushing a pawn<br>
How many dreams are torn <br>
How many storms<br>
<br>
So I'm taking a spin on the wheel<br>
It must be me bouncing inside<br>
I am taking a spin on the wheel<br>
Come red or black, it's bona fide<br>

Got a one-way ticket to let it go and ride
So spin the wheel

The roulette is on
Life is upon on us

From the very first sign of the sun
We're on the run
Things we would have never done
Making us one

The roulette is on

Place my bets all alone
These crazy stones
I'm putting my red shoes on
And then I'm gone




All Is One
Music and Lyrics - Pablo Casella, Sophia Ammann and Tom Callens 

Laid back and watched by the sky
One frame of life is passing by
Among the birds, mountains and aeroplanes 
Around sorrow, joy and flames

All is one part of me
I become gracefully 
Golden

Arms, wings, a moving eager mass
Searching a kind of happiness 
Scattered, hidden in the grass

All is one part of you
As the light shimmers through
Golden

Absence and questions
A rose dies
Melodies and measures
And thunder skies
Butterflies and buildings
A kingdom falls
Islands and feelings
Weigh nothing at all

Footsteps in the wet grass
Waking up my toes
I look up, the sun is low

All is one part of you
As the light shimmers through
All is one part of us
We become light as dust
Golden






Getting Out
Music and Lyrics - Tom Callens 

I've been dancing 
all night long
didn't find 
what I was looking for
Is it just me 
or the things that I do
This confusion is tying me up
I don't seem to get through

Am I getting out?
Am I getting out?
They say to me only time will tell
I just hope it is true

The world keeps turning 
all day long
And I find myself 
standing all alone
I know that one day
It will all melt away
To the core of all things that be
In nothingness I'll stay




















Morning Sun
Music and Lyrics - Tom Callens 

Sitting with you in the morning sun, 
silently holding hands
The air has a bitter-sweet scent, 
for this moment
I should never forget
Sitting with you in the morning sun, 
in silence we understand
That it all must come to an end, 
for this moment...
I will never forget

I thought I knew 
the morning dew
The smell of wet stones
the birth of new sounds
Inside me grew
a feeling new
How long would it last
was I going too fast?

As I pass back through the park
where we went after dark
My mind is engulfed and embarks
the being of it all now seems quite far

I thought I'd figured out
the beating of our hearts
How soft is your skin
the fragrance of your hair
Inside us grew
a feeling new
We knew it wouldn't last
already it was simple past

And I'm walking under the arc
where we strolled after dark
Like two careless birds making nests
forever together while it lasts



Mirror of Everyone
Music - Tom Callens Lyrics - Pablo Casella and Sophia Ammann

Surrounded 
By a thousand people
Never felt so alone

Some days 
I drown in the mass
Out of phase, I'm not there

Ungrounded 
Losing definition
Nothing left, nothing sure 

These days I forget everything
Everything that I am
These days I remain
Everything that I'm not
That I'm not

I'm in the mirror of everyone
In the mirror of everyone I stand
Reflection meeting them
Before they meet the one
I am

Some days
I dive in their vision
Blurry gaze, so unpure    

These days I forget everything
Everything that I am
These days I remain
Everything that I'm not
That I'm not








Cold Wind
Music - Sophia Ammann and Tom Callens Lyrics - Sophia Ammann

There's a cold, cold, cold wind
A cold wind blowing now
But I'm still standing
I'm still standing
I'm still holding out

Senses open wide
Feeling all around
Senses open wide
Nearly overthrown by lightning 
of shivering fever
Distant is the beating of my heart

No armour, no shield 
Between the world and me
No armour, no shield
All these arrows piercing and cutting 
through my skin so easily
Distant is the beating of my heart

Bring on the storm
Bring on the rain

Let the skies burst open
Let the water pour down
Dusty whirlwinds raging trough grim land
Wild winds in the grip of the night's hands
Lightning flashes and lights up the black sky

In the eye of silent wells 
In between as my time dwells










Lost
Music and Lyrics - Sophia Ammann 

Can't stand a friend
Can't stand a lover
She can't stand my skin
Can't stand no other

I feel lost and disconnected
Unwanted and out of place
Lost and disconnected 
Unwanted and out of place

She is never satisfied 
And each day just passes by
She's lost the hunger, and desire
And each day just passes by

People always rushing
Things to do, places to be
Running after happiness
Running after nothing

Makes me feel lost and disconnected
Unwanted and out of place
Lost and disconnected 
Unwanted and out of place

















In a Silent Way
Music and Lyrics - Pablo Casella 

There you stand unaware of me
Catching leaves of beauty
That you drop on the floor 
As you do nothing more than existing

With your tongue between your teeth 
Laughing shy, unpurposely
You point at me a gun
That you shoot just for fun
And I gently bleed

And it tastes like salt and sweet
Everyday it makes me strong and weak
At the sunrise I try to deny
While I'm feeding you in me

There you stand unaware of all this
So that's how it's supposed to be
I can just hope, at last,
For a life without past, no history

When I close my eyes I see
You close to me, so close to me
Then your lips touch mine 
As I sketch in my mind
The outline of a kiss

Everyday it makes me strong and weak
At the sunrise I try to deny
While I'm feeding you in me

I keep on waiting for the day
You would hear what I don't say
It feels so far away
I'm afraid you never will
And still I need to love you
In a silent way




Father's Land
Music - Tom Callens Lyrics - Pablo Casella and Sophia Ammann

Bending knees, feet in the air
Blinded by a sunlight flare
Try to reach higher clouds  
Evergreen is the life around 
In every being
As the swing is swinging for the first time
In my father's land

Lifted up by giant hands
Flying through air at full blast
Golden hair hanging down
Screams of joy
Childish chatter, losing balance
Sounds of laughter, landing back
Into the memory of a playground 

Bending knees, feet in the air
Wondering what it's like up there
Try to reach higher clouds
Till old leaves do their dance 
Announcing change of seasons
And the swing is swinging 
For the last time in my father's land

I'm swinging for the last time in my father's land

















Suddenly
Music and Lyrics - Pablo Casella

What if we cease to share
Things we pretend to feel
What if we get distracted 

What if we stop neglecting 
All we already know
What if we get reflected

In this bright light beam
What if we suddenly choose to dream

What if dare to live
Everyday something new
What if we get connected 

Through a clear running stream
What if we simply choose to see

So it might just let us
Float above these undefined lines
So it might just let us
Move away from everything
We don't mean

What if we stop regretting
Times when it was all too real
What if we get suspended 

In this bright light beam
What if we suddenly choose to dream











Border of You
Music - Pablo Casella and Tom Callens Lyrics - Pablo Casella

Once again I open the door
Looking at this restless decor
Just to see how the land escapes me

Once again I open the door
Riding to the bottom, to the core
Just to feel so unbearably real

I can't get back in there, Iâ€™ve tried
But I won't let myself outside
Inventing corners and different views
On the border of you

Once again I open my eyes
And there is a question that lies 
In a place where everything is so vague

So again I open the door
And again I hold back, unsure
In this field between me and my will

Arid, solemn wind
By the willow tree
Branches waving sadly free

Lonesome river flow
On an endless leap
Forging it's way through
Dark deep












Golden Ring
Music and Lyrics - Pablo Casella

Down the road she walks alone
Quietness all around
Sounding loud and cold

Far and unseen, one golden ring
Falls in metal bowl 
Measuring the scene 

She holds a step but won't look back

Peace, lonely as it is
Through the lack of sound
Blows a free night wind

So it sings, faintly as a morning fog
Painting in grey all the words 
she couldn't say
And she runs into indifference 
Lost now and then on her way to silence

Where does she come from, where to go
There's no such a thing
On this endless road

She has to weave from memories
All what's left behind
Loose and empty 

So much unsaid, she looks ahead

And leaves, to know how to breathe
To know how to flow
Through this free night wind

So it sings, faintly as a morning fog
Painting in grey all the words 
she couldn't say
And she runs into indifference 
Lost now and then down that same old way again
