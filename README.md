# LittleDots-WebSite

This is the code for the website of the musical band [LittleDots](littledots.info) . This website was developed by Simon Segers. My contribution will be to update it to display content relative to the band's new album release coming out in the fall 2018. Links to the different versions and appropriate credits will be provided here.
